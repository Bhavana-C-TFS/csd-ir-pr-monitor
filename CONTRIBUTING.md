# Contribution

Please read the [Thermo Fisher Inner Source Guidelines](https://confluence.amer.thermo.com/display/CA/Inner+Source+Guidelines).

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We appreciate your effort and time. 

If you are interested in contributing, you can find open issues and bugs [in our issues board](https://github.com/thermofisher/YOUR_REPO_NAME/issues).


## What we're looking for
We hope that you will consider contributing to this project. You can contribute in many ways. For example, you might:

* Add documentation and “how-to” articles to the README or documentation space.

* Help people with the questions they ask on the Discourse/Microsoft Teams channel.

* Create an extension that provides additional functionality.

* Improve the existing application to demonstrate features.

* Work on bugs you've found in the issues Board.

When contributing, we ask that you:

* Let us know what you plan in the ticket comments.

* Provide tests and documentation. It is very unlikely that we will accept new features or functionality without the proper testing. When fixing a bug, provide a failing test case that your patch solves.

* Open a Pull Request with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that we are also working and it may take us some time to get back to you. Thanks for your patience. 


## What we're not looking for 

Specific to each team, this can be ommitted if it's not needed. 


## Code of Conduct
We take our inner source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Ground Rules

Keep in mind, we work with the following [Code Conventions](#code-conventions) and expect new features to be developed following them as closely as possible. 


## How to contribute

The Thermo Fisher Inner Source Guidelines can be found [here](https://confluence.amer.thermo.com/display/CA/Inner+Source+Guidelines).

If you're unfamiliar to the process of contributing, read this [quick guide](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions) that explains how, if you have any more questions feel free to reach out to the team.

After you have followed the previous guidelines, ensure your commit meets the following rules:

* Commits must have the ticket numer as a prefix before the message (e.g. "[JIRA-123] implemented thing")
* Add the issue category to your pull request message (BUG, HOTFIX, FEATURE)

## How to report an issue

Please report issues [in our issues board](https://github.com/thermofisher/YOUR_REPO_NAME/issues).
Check if your issue is a Bug Report or a Feature Request, select the issue template accordingly, and fill it in.


## Code Review process
The maintainers for this project look at Pull Requests on a regular basis. One maintainer is needed to review and approve the submitted code. 
After the code gets approved it will be merged with the master branch and deployed. If the deployment is completed successfully the Pull Request gets closed. 

If after the code review the Pull Request is denied, feedback will be given in the issue ticket, and the Pull Request closed.

If you want to give more clarity on the Code Review process followed, you can add a checklist here, like [this one](https://github.com/mgreiler/code-review-checklist/blob/master/README.md)
